Tic-tac-toe for The Odin Project while learning the principles of modular Javascript

# Thoughts Before Coding this Project

## New Things
To Start, I have close to zero experience in coding and designing an Object Oriented or a modular project, so this will be a challenge for me.

## The Plan
I already know that game programming will need an init(), update() and draw() function from my experiences in doing similar game projects (pico8 platform and pygame). I will have to structure this in a similar way and encapsulate everything in a Game() object.
